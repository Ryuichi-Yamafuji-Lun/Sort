Insert Sort:
The insertion sort starts from the left and compares the value next to it with the value on the left. If value on the left is greater then it swaps with the value on the right. It continues this process until the value on the right is greater than the value on the left.

Quick Sort:
Quick sort takes a partition and numbers that are less than the partitioned number goes to the left and numbers greater than the partitioned number goes to the right. The partioned number is then placed in the middle of the left and right groups and a new partition is chosen and repeats this process until the array is sorted. 
The partion number is the rightmost number of the array of either the left or right blocks of number created by the previous partitioned numbers.
